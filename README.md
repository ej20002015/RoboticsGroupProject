## Instructions for Development
Do not make changes directly on the main branch. Before making changes please do the following
- First checkout the main branch using ```git checkout main```
- Run ```git pull``` to update your local repository with the latest changes
- To start making your changes, create a new branch and checkout (navigate) to it using ```git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>```
- After commiting your changes to your local branch, to push your changes to the remote run ```git push --set-upstream origin <BRANCH_NAME>```
- Go to GitLab and create a Pull Request to merge your local <BRANCH_NAME> into main
- At this point ask another group member to approve your PR to ensure your changes are valid
- If a merge conflict arises ask Evan :)
- If all is fine, complete the PR and your changes will be merged onto main
